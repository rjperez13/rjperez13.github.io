		<h4>Together, Kristine and Rodya conducted a usability evaluation on the University of Illinois website using Jakob
		Nielsen's ten heuristics as their framework. In doing so, their goal was to conduct
		a thorough analysis capturing both the positive and negative design aspects. Overall
		usability was a top priority, with a special emphasis on the user. Their analysis
		considered how much importance the web designers at Illinois put into designing an
		efficient and effective website for all types of users. After all, users are at the heart and soul of
		the design process and should never be overlooked. </h4><br>
		<h4>What follows is their analysis. Enjoy :)!</h4><br>

		<h2><strong>1. Visibility of system status</strong></h2>
		<br>
		<blockquote> "The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time."
		<br> <cite><b>&#8211; Jakob Nielsen</b></cite></blockquote>
		<br>
		<p>It's important to never leave your users in the dark and to be upfront with them at all times. You never want users feeling lost as if they were in a foreign land. You want your website to be as accommodating as a five star hotel with a clearly marked path every step of the way. So remember, whenever you're lost, just look for the friendly Illinois logo.</p>
		<br>

		</div>
		<h3>Ambiguity on the For Students Page</h3>
		<p>Although, we are located on the "For Students" page, it is unclear for the user to identify what page they are on. Due to the multiple misleading titles (highlighted in blue), there is ambiguity as to what page you're actually on.  A user might assume that they are on the "UIAA News" page since the text stands out, so a better solution would be to have the title of the page appear in the box entitled "Insert System Visibility Here."</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<a href="images/largescreenshots/vis2.jpg" rel="lightbox[vis]" ><img src="images/thumbnails/vist2.jpg" alt="v2" ></a>
		</div>
		<h3>THE A-Z MYSTERY</h3>
		<p> Although it may be obvious that one is at the A-Z index, the page is titled "Illinois DIrectory" which bears the exact same header title as the Directory page. It would feel more appropriate if the header title read, "Illinois A-Z Index" as opposed to having it listed as subscript in grey text. This way, it would be obvious that one was at the A-Z index directory. Another minor problem is the difficulty in seeing the dividing border on the navigation bar to the left. I have marked the border with a bolded red line to show how difficult it is to see the border separating the content. </p>

		</div>
		<h3>THE OVERSHADOWED ACADEMICS PAGE</h3>
		<p>Here we find ourselves on the "Academics" page, but the main title of the page is overshadowed by the bolded subtext, which is also a darker shade of blue. Although not a major issue, I would think that the title of the page would want to emphasized. </p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	</div>

	<div class="section" id="section-3">
		<h2><strong>2. Match between system & the real world</strong></h2>
		<br>
		<blockquote> "The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather
		than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order."
		<br> <cite><b>&#8211; Jakob Nielsen</b></cite></blockquote>
		<br>
		<p>It's important to stay away from terms that most users will not understand. A website should be designed in such a way that makes it easy for any user to be able to relate to it. The logic of the site should adhere to the rules and norms present in the outside world. Again, you don't want to scare away users with fancy words or an overly complex website. </p>
		<br>
		<div class="screenshot">

		</div>
		<h3>SO WHAT EXACTLY IS PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT?</h3>
		<p>Public Engagement - Is a political term that is not really understood by normal users and is more catered to a political audience. And upon clicking "Public Engagement", it still remains unclear as to what exactly the University of Illinois is trying to get at. The boxed area is the closest thing to a mission statement, but it doesn't become fully clear until one clicks the "Engagement at Illinois" page, which should be renamed to "About Engagement at Illinois." I feel that it takes too much time and effort to figure out what is meant by Public Engagement. </p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<a href="images/largescreenshots/match2.jpg" rel="lightbox[match]" ><img src="images/thumbnails/matcht2.jpg" alt="m2" ></a>
		</div>
		<h3>DID SOMEBODY SAY ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE?</h3>
		<p>Found under the "About Us" page, the term "academic excellence" is vague at best, but implies that the University of Illinois prides itself in being a distinguished university in terms of academics. Thus, one would think that by clicking on the hypertext, you would be taken to a page where such boasting is confirmed or backed up. Instead you are linked to their "Academics" page, as opposed to being linked to their "Rankings" page, which would make more sense. </p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<a href="images/largescreenshots/match3.jpg" rel="lightbox[match]" ><img src="images/thumbnails/matcht3.jpg" alt="m3" ></a>
		</div>
		<h3>THE MYSTERY OF EMAIL</h3>
		<p> The e-mail link on the header is a vague term until one clicks on it. In no way does the "e-mail" link deal with the ability to email someone, but rather is a link that deals with the e-mail services offered by the University. A more appropriate name would be one that explicitly states the function of the link, like say, "Log-in to E-mail Services" or simply "E-mail Services."</p>

		</div>
		<h3>JUST HOW INCLUSIVE IS ILLINOIS REALY</h3>
		<p> What exactly is meant by Inclusive Illinois... it's a distinct and specific name that most people will not get, and probably skip over. It's very vague and is probably only understood by a small percentage of people, alienating all users who are not "in the know."</p>

		<h2><strong>3. User control & freedom</strong></h2>
		<br>
		<blockquote> "Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit"
		to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo."
		<br> <cite><b>&#8211; Jakob Nielsen</b></cite></blockquote>
		<br>
		<p>The user must always feel as if they are the captain of their ship. The user must always be in control of what happens on screen. Backseat driving should not be allowed. If you constantly are making decisions for your users, you will lose their trust, and they will not feel safe browsing your website. So remember to let your users feel as if they have ultimate control, make them feel as if they have a voice. </p>
		<br>

		</div>
		<h3>ILLINOIS TEACHES US TO BE PATIENT</h3>
		<p>Upon entering the videos page, the video loads but does not play allowing the user to remain in control. Also take note of the text, which lets the user know in advance that it takes a little bit of time for the videos to load.</p>

		</div>
		<h3>ILLINOIS TAKES OVER OUR BROWSER</h3>
		<p>On a different note, clicking some text opens up new tabs, which takes away some power and control from the user. One such example is found on the home page when clicking the text below "A Minute With."</p>
		<br>

		</div>
		<h3>THE INCONSIDERATE GALLERY SLIDESHOW</h3>
		<p>On the home page, there is no way for the user to control the gallery of rotating pictures. So in the event that a user wants to view a specific picture, but missed their chance, they have to wait for the picture to come up again. This may frustrate some users, which is never a good thing.</p>
		<br>

		<h3>GOOD GUY GALLERY </h3>
		<p>In contrast to the previous lack of user control, this gallery of pictures offers the ideal amount of user control. Users are given the ability to scroll through the gallery of pictures by either clicking the left or right arrows.</p>

	<div class="section" id="section-5">
		<h2><strong>4. Consistency & standards</strong></h2>
		<br>
		<blockquote> "Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions
		mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions."
		<br> <cite><b>&#8211; Jakob Nielsen</b></cite></blockquote>
		<br>
		<p>Users aren't too fond of change, and they dislike having to learn a new way of doing something they already knew how to do. Users are good at picking up inconsistencies in your site, whether it be layout or word usage, and you don't want to lose credibility with your users. </p>

		<h3>IM LOST AND WANT TO GO HOME</h3>
		<p> A majority of the time, the website does an excellent job at providing a way for the user to link back to the home page via the logo. However, this is one case in which the website fails, since the Indiana logo is not clickable. Thus, users may feel disappointment or even fooled for thinking that the logo would always serve as an anchor (or safe point) that would act as a safety valve in case users got lost within the website.</p>
		<br>

		<p>The header lacks icons on most every page, with the exception of one page. </p>

		<h2><strong>5. Error prevention</strong></h2>
		<br>
		<blockquote> "Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem
		from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for
		them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action."
		<br> <cite><b>&#8211; Jakob Nielsen</b></cite></blockquote>
		<br>
		<p>The best way to fix a problem is to stop it before it even happens. Keeping in mind that we all make mistakes, it becomes important to not punish users for any mistakes they may make. This requires some foresight because as a designer, you must anticipate errors that users are likely to commit and set up a safety net. In doing so, you will put your users at ease and gain their trust. </p>
		<br>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<a href="images/largescreenshots/error1.jpg" rel="lightbox[error]" ><img src="images/thumbnails/errort1.jpg" alt="error1" ></a>
		</div>
		<h3>YOU SHALL NOT PASS</h3>
		<p>Note how the "continue" button is greyed out and unclickable, preventing the user from moving on to the next step. This is an added safety measure that won't allow users to continue if they haven't made a donation. In addition, any input that are not numbers is not allowed in the text field. If a user attempts to type a word, the letter is immediately erased.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<a href="images/largescreenshots/error2.jpg" rel="lightbox[cons]" ><img src="images/thumbnails/errort2.jpg" alt="error2" ></a>
		</div>
		<h3>FIELD REQUIRED</h3>
		<p>The red asterisk symbol is generally understood to denote the required input fields when filling out a form. They function as a way of stopping users from skipping over necessary inputs of information. However, they fail to explicitly state this, which novice users may not know. Usually, websites mark the * symbol in the following manner: *Required field.</p>
		<br>

		<h3>CAN I HAVE YO ZIP CODE </h3>
		<p> Another safety valve that the website makes use of is preventing users from inputting more than a five digit zip code. </p>

		<h2><strong>6. Recognition rather than recall</strong></h2>
		<br>
		<blockquote> "Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible.
		The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another.
		Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate."
		<br> <cite><b>&#8211; Jakob Nielsen</b></cite></blockquote>
		<br>
			<p>Visual information seemingly speeds by in the blink of an eye and individuals are prone
			to scanning to quickly access their desired information. By keeping this propensity in mind,
			usability design leans toward recognition rather than recall to lessen a user's memory load.
			With the usage of bread crumbs, ingenious color coding, and peculiar styles, a website is
			able to serve reminders for users rather than having them retrieve it from their vast memory.
			What you set your eyes on should be what you'll receive.</p>

		</div>
		<h3>UBIQUITOUS LOGO + COLOR</h3>
		<p> As you navigate away from the main website to linked sites such as the "International" page, the University of
		Illinois logo remains on the page to enable users to navigate back to the main site. The logo illuminates as a
		strong brand identity and lets the viewer know that it is the trademark for the college. Although this is a great
		feature, it is not always obvious whether or not the logo is clickable. Color-wise, the blue and orange tints are
		major representations of the college's spirit and by shading every page with hints school colors, the UI website lets
		users easily recognize their colors. </p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<a href="images/largescreenshots/reco2.jpg" rel="lightbox[reco]" ><img src="images/thumbnails/recot2.jpg" alt="r2" ></a>
		</div>
		<h3>HEADERS + MISSING BREAD CRUMBS</h3>
		<p> The hierarchy of the website is complex as destinations have no historical path. The absences of breadcrumbs
		make it difficult to trace where you've navigated from. There are some pages in which you can only navigate to
		within another page; this creates a virtual labyrinth for users. This one-way street doesn't allow users to
		navigate back to previous pages easily--there are no u-turns on this road. The headers for some pages are inconsistent
		to the navigation bar title. For example, the "about us" page is titled "Who We Are." The
		site lacks appropriate elements to let users recognize items easily; recall is the main go-to method for
		the University of Illinois website as its website is a web of intricacy. The density and text-heavy components
		of the website decreases the ability of recognition as too many other things get in the way. </p>
		<br>
		<br>

	</div>
	
	<div class="section" id="section-8">
		<h2><strong>7. Flexibility & efficiency of use</strong></h2>
		<br>
		<blockquote> "Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the
		interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced
		and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions."
		<br> <cite><b>&#8211; Jakob Nielsen</b></cite></blockquote>
		<br>
			<p>Since there is a diversity of viewers, websites need to be adaptable
			to a wide range of audiences from everyday novices to savvy connoisseurs.
			No matter how equipped a person's skill set is, the website should be able
			to mold and efficiently let the users navigate.</p>
		<br>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<a href="images/largescreenshots/eff1.jpg" rel="lightbox[efficiency]" ><img src="images/thumbnails/efft1.jpg" alt="e1" ></a>
		</div>
		<h3>Where'd you go?</h3>
		<p> A great deal of visitors refer to the "resources for" section to find crucial information,
		but the extensive menu only exists on the homepage. This makes it extremely difficult for users
		to navigate to their desired destination as breadcrumbs or a new menu is not available for them to
		backtrack. For inexperienced users, this may cause extreme uncertainty as they don't know where to go
		on from thereon. </p>
		<br>

		<div class="screenshot">
			<a href="images/largescreenshots/eff2.jpg" rel="lightbox[efficiency]" ><img src="images/thumbnails/efft2.jpg" alt="e2" ></a>
		</div>
		<h3>SEARCH BAR</h3>
		<p> Since the search bar is located at the top of the page, this makes it effortless for users to
		discover wanted information. Having the directory and Illinois option lets user choose the appropriate
		category for their search. Even though this is a great feature, a fixed search bar at the top might make
		searching more efficient rather than having to scroll all the way back to the top. Another positive aspect
		of the search bar is that it lets you complete another search without having to go back to the new page--in
		fact it has two places to search again.</p>

		<h2><strong>8. Aesthetic & minimalist design</strong></h2>
		<br>
		<blockquote> "Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or
		rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the
		relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility."
		<br> <cite><b>&#8211; Jakob Nielsen</b></cite></blockquote>
		<br>
			<p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but websites will be overall
			attractive to different types of users with the execution of aesthetically
			pleasing and minimalist design. Organization is the key in this principle.
			Making sure essential information is apparent and avoiding clutter will definitely
			bring comfort to users' eyes. Conversely, "what goes together semantically goes together
			visually" and this informational gem will make sure websites arrange properly (<i>Kirsh, lecture</i>). </p>

		</div>
		<h3>NAVIGATION BLOCKAGE</h3>
		<p> The Colleges and School menu list blocks the vital resources for respective audiences such as
		students, alumni, faculty, etc.. This necessary information is layered on top of the other navigations
		for the resources and could have been placed to expand on the right side instead. Disabling users to see
		this menu is a faulty design execution which could be fixed. </p>
		<br>

		</div>
		<h3>BARE WHITE SPACE</h3>
		<p> On the left side of the sub-pages, there is odd blank space that is reserved for extended menus only
		placed on some of the other pages. This unalignment and ineffectual usage of space makes the placement of
		text look off. By shifting the sub-menu on the right to the left side instead, users will be able to easily
		utilize the menu as users are used to reading from left to right. This not only make the space look clean
		and the page fittingly situated on the page, but it ensures that text is more refreshing to the eyes. The
		contrasting image headers do not compliment the pages as well since they lack aesthetic style. </p>
		<br>

		</div>
		<h3>DISORGANIZED + LACK OF STRUCTURE</h3>
		<p> Although the website does use different tints of orange and blue to fill in letters and bold them, sections in
		the pages aren't as easily distinguishable due to the lack of clear separation. The website needs a touch of
		simplicity as it is quite overwhelming to look at. Clear section dividers would help improve the website to make it
		spick-and-span.  The structure of the website can immensely be improved with good usage of space and insertion of
		nicely sized images would help add some pizazz to the site. </p>

		<br>
			<p>When you hit a wall while maneuvering through a website, there should be

		<h3>"no results" page </h3>
		<p> "No result" pages oftentimes put users in a frenzy as they are lost with where to go on from there. The University of Illinois
		website has several of these errors (one is pictured to the left). When a user misspells financial aid when using the
		directory search query, they are lead to a no results page. Suggestions on similar spellings may aid users, but the page

		<h3>spelling correction</h3>
		<p> Although there is no auto-correct function for the website, spelling error corrections in some of the search queries

		results for the corrected spelling of  financial aid instead. It offers a substituted result for the following misspelling.  </p>

		<h3>404 error  *page not found* </h3>
		<p> The external link for "apply for admission online" under the contacts category leads to a 404 error page. In this case, the

		<h3>form submission </h3>
		<p> The external link for "apply for admission online" under the contacts category leads to a 404 error page. In this case, the
		link automatically redirects to an error page that has no specifications on how to reach the working site. The page
		ceases to exist and asks the users to click another link to explain where the page error emerged from. This is

		<h3>POP-UP </h3>
		<p> When filling out the form found under the "Giving to Illinois" page, there are good measures taken to ensure errors are prevented, or at the very least, brought to the users attention.  </p>

		<h2><strong>10. Help & Documentation</strong></h2>
		<br>
		<blockquote> "Even though it is better if the system can be used without
		documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such
		information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to
		be carried out, and not be too large."
		<br> <cite><b>&#8211; Jakob Nielsen</b></cite></blockquote>
		<br>
		<p>Despite of the superb quality of any website, help and documentation serves as an alternative SOS to answer curious or taxing questions.
		The University of Illinois definitely shines in this category compared to other University websites as it offers webpage specifics. Although
		this is a major plus, the website does not make this section obvious as it is hidden in the footer.</p>

		<h3>"HELP" Search Results</h3>
		<p>When "help" is inserted into the search bar, users are directed to a page providing resourceful links
		regarding to a variety of types of help. The results, however, do not provide a direct link to the website's
		own help page. For instance, by clicking on the first link "CITES," users are led to an entirely different website
		for technical service help. </p>

		<h3>About This Site Page</h3>
		<p>Notably, the University of Illinois website provides an "about this site" section located on the footer.
		When opened, the user will be able to learn about the design team, design, features, and past looks. They
		offer an extensive menu bar on the left side to let you know just a little bit more of why the site was
		rebuilt and gives you a gist of the background of the website. </p>

		<h3>emergency info</h3>
		<p>When trouble comes your way outside of the internet, the university provides an emergency information section.
